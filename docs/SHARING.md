# Sharing This Package

This project (`neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl/`) is a **self-contained package** that can be shared independently.

## What's Included

All necessary files are in this directory:
- ✅ All Python scripts (no external dependencies on parent directories)
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Documentation (README.md, ORCHESTRATOR.md, etc.)
- ✅ Source data (in `source_data/` directory, tracked in git)
- ✅ Demo data generation script (`setup_demo_data.py`)
- ✅ Logging configuration

## Options for Sharing

### Option 1: Create a Standalone Repository (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- Clean, professional presentation
- Easy version control
- Customer can clone and use immediately
- No confusion about what's included

**Steps:**
```bash
# If sharing from an existing repo, create a new directory
cd /path/to/wherever
mkdir neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl
cd neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl
git init

# Copy the entire project directory contents
# Replace /path/to/source with your actual source directory
cp -r /path/to/source/neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl/* .
cp -r /path/to/source/neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl/.gitignore .
cp -r /path/to/source/neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl/.gitattributes .

# Initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Blue/Green Arrow ETL demo package"
```

### Option 2: Zip/Tarball the Directory

**Pros:**
- Quick and simple
- No git setup needed

**Steps:**
```bash
# From the parent directory of the project
cd /path/to/parent
tar -czf neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl.tar.gz neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl/
# or
zip -r neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl.zip neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl/
```

### Option 3: Create a Git Subtree or Submodule

If you want to keep it in the same repo but shareable:
- Use `git subtree` to extract just this directory
- Or create a separate branch with only this directory

## Path Configuration

All paths in `config.yaml` are now **relative** to the script location, making the package portable:
- `base_path: 'data'` resolves to `{package_dir}/data/`
- Source data is in `source_data/` directory (tracked in git)
- `setup_demo_data.py` copies from `source_data/` to `data/{customer}/{timestamp}/`

## Customer Setup

After sharing, the customer should:

1. **Extract/Clone** the package
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl
   
   # If using Git LFS (recommended for Parquet files)
   git lfs pull
   ```
2. **Update `config.yaml`** with their Neo4j connection details:
   ```yaml
   neo4j:
     host: their-neo4j-host
     arrow_port: 8491
     bolt_port: 7687
     user: neo4j
     password: their-password
   ```
3. **Run the demo**:
   ```bash
   cd neo4j-blue-green-arrow-etl
   python scripts/setup_demo_data.py  # Generate demo data first
   python scripts/demo_workflow.py
   ```

## What's NOT Included

- Generated demo data in `data/` (ignored by git, generated by `setup_demo_data.py`)
- Any parent directory files
- Development history (unless using git)

## Data Setup

After cloning, users need to generate the demo data:

```bash
python scripts/setup_demo_data.py
```

This copies Parquet files from `source_data/` to `data/{customer}/{timestamp}/` for simulation.

The package is completely self-contained and ready to share!
